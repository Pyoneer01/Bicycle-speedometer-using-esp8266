# Bicycle Speedometer Project

This project utilizes an ESP8266 microcontroller to measure and display the speed of a bicycle. A Hall effect sensor detects the wheel's revolutions, and a servo motor is used to visually indicate the speed via an analog display. The system calculates the speed based on the frequency of wheel revolutions and controls the servo motor accordingly.


## Components Used

- ESP8266 microcontroller
- Hall effect sensor
- Servo motor
- Magnet (attached to the bicycle wheel)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- Battery (3.3 V)

## Assembly Instructions

1. Attach the magnet to the bicycle wheel.
2. Place the Hall effect sensor so it can detect the magnet passing by with each wheel revolution.
3. Connect the ESP8266, Hall effect sensor, and servo motor using jumper wires on the breadboard.
4. Power the circuit with a battery.
5. Upload the code to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
